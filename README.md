File Tracker is a tool that safely and easily speeds up global updates of software changes of thousands of files across hundreds of projects and systems.  The result typically pays off thousands of man-hours of technical debt per team member in just a few hours with the first use (i.e. it pays for itself).  Since it is a very hands-on tool, using it is less error-prone and therefore less likely to break existing software projects than to do the same work manually.

CubicleSoft File Tracker is commercial, non-free software.  [Purchase a File Tracker license](https://file-tracker.cubiclesoft.com/) to obtain the software.
